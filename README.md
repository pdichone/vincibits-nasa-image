## NASA Image of the Day!

This script will pull an image from NASA's image of the day API, and then generate a PDF file with the image along with the image's description.

Watch the tutorial video on my channel [VinciBits](https://www.youtube.com/@vincibits).

## You Need To:
Run `pip install requests Pillow fpdf`

Then, you need an API key from NASA. 
You can get a free key from NASA's API https://api.nasa.gov/.

Once you have the API key, go to `main.py` and replace ` NASA_API_KEY = (
        "Your API Here"  # Replace with your NASA API key
    )` "Your API Here" with your NASA API key.
